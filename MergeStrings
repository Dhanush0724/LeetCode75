You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string
Return the merged string.
Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r


code:
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):

        merged = []
        n = len(word1)
        m = len(word2)
        i,j = 0,0
        while i<n and j<m:
            merged.append(word1[i])
            merged.append(word2[j])
            i += 1
            j+= 1

        while i<n:
            merged.append(word1[i])
            i+=1
        
        while j<m:
            merged.append(word2[j])
            j+=1

        return "".join(merged)

sol = Solution()
word1 = "abc"
word2 = "pqr"
res = sol.mergeAlternately(word1, word2)
print(res)
